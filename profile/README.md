   - Creation, maintenance, and deletion of user identities.  
   - Automates onboarding and offboarding processes.

2. **Authentication**  
   - Verifies a userâ€™s identity before granting access.  
   - Includes methods like passwords, biometrics, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and single sign-on (SSO).

3. **Authorization & Access Control**  
   - Defines and enforces user permissions.  
   - Implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC).

4. **Directory Services**  
   - Centralized repositories for storing user identities (e.g., Active Directory, LDAP).

5. **Federated Identity & Single Sign-On (SSO)**  
   - Allows users to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials.  
   - Uses protocols like SAML, OAuth, and OpenID Connect.

6. **Identity Governance & Compliance**  
   - Ensures that identity policies comply with regulatory standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).  
   - Includes auditing, monitoring, and reporting tools.

7. **Privileged Access Management (PAM)**  
   - Controls access to critical systems for high-level users like administrators.  
   - Implements Just-In-Time (JIT) access and session monitoring.
